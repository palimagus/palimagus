### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a junior fullstack developper, self-taught with most of the Javascript Frameworks out there.
I wanted to learn more backend technologies so I'm currently learning GoLang and Rust.

- Make some CLI tools
- Make some servers from scratch
- Use cargo packages like `serde` and `clap` 
- Make a website (using Yew?)
